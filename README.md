# YOLOv8 Face Mask Detection Experiment

This repository documents a quick experiment to train a **YOLOv8** model on a public face mask dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal was to explore the training process and log all metrics, predictions, and results to the **Weights & Biases** platform for analysis.
